package hotelapp;

/** The driver class for project 4
 * Copy your project 3 classes to the hotelapp package.
 * The main function should take the following command line arguments:
 * -hotels hotelFile -reviews reviewsDirectory -threads numThreads -output filepath
 * (order may be different)
 * and read general information about the hotels from the hotelFile (a JSON file),
 * as read hotel reviews from the json files in reviewsDirectory (can be multithreaded or
 * single-threaded).
 * The data should be loaded into data structures that allow efficient search.
 * If the -output flag is provided, hotel information (about all hotels and reviews)
 * should be output into the given file.
 * Then in the main method, you should start an HttpServer that responds to
 * requests about hotels and reviews.
 * See pdf description of the project for the requirements.
 * You are expected to add other classes and methods from project 3 to this project,
 * and take instructor's / TA's feedback from a code review into account.
 * Please download the input folder from Canvas.
